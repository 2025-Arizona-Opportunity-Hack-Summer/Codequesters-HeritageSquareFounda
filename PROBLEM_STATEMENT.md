# Heritage Square Foundation Requirements

The people of Heritage Square Foundation have a vision to harness the power of shared personal and community experiences to enrich and transform lives.

## MISSION:
Heritage Square Foundation is dedicated to preserving and sharing the stories, collection, historic buildings and grounds of Heritage Square, serving as a relevant, engaging, and inclusive community resource and as a tangible connection to our diverse local history.

## Problem Statement 1: 
In order to use AI for grants and marketing, before prompting, a staff person needs multiple documents uploaded for each question. This is very time consuming and potentially inaccurate.
 
* AI Agent has access to documents on Heritage Square Google drives.
* Having access to all the documents and pictures on the Heritage Square Google drives will allow the staff to ask questions to the agent and get specific, individualized responses. AI will ‘know’ this organization.
* The AI agent can be whichever works best for this problem. Kari has used chatgpt and found it to be the best, but thinks that Gemini might be a better solution due to the compatibility with Google Drive. 
* Access to the drives will need to be given to AI agents and hackers by Kari.  You should try to do this on your own during the hackathon and then once you have a solution, see if some example documents from Heritage Square Foundation can be processed.

### Result: 
Increase accuracy when using AI prompts. This will save time and allow Kari to spend more time planning and running the organization. 

## Problem Statement 2:
Heritage Square’s google drive is unorganized and difficult to find documents that are needed for marketing, operations, and grants.
* AI Agent can assist with finding documents and potentially suggest best ways to reorganize the drives.
* AI Agent can add tags or labels to the documents based on high level categories provided. 
* Once files are labeled, AI can suggest how to organize the files give specific parameters, ie. group by year/month and then sort by creation dates and then labels. 
* Actually move the files into above organized google shared drives. 
* Categories: 
    * Accounting
    * Curation
    * Development (contributed revenue generation)
    * Employee resources (HR)
    * Board of Directors
    * Marketing
    * Operations 
    * Programming
    * Research (historic info -
    * Images (historic vs not historic) - can be a third phase if needed, after the hackathon is completed
* Sample drive and sample files in each category will be helpful
* Kari needs to provide access credentials to the test google drive.
* Group files by creation dates (example format: ddyymm)
* Sort files by creation dates


### Result: 
Increase productivity when looking for documents.

If this project opens up enough time, then the $10k Google Ad Grant may be an option. Right now Kari doesn’t have a resource to manage this.
